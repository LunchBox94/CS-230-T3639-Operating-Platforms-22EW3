Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

 

The Gaming Room is an Android game developing company that has had other products that were released with much success and are now looking to expand this success into multiple platforms and devices Including Windows OS, mobile phones, Linux, and Mac. The new products the gaming room was wanting to develop, and release were a game called Draw it or Lose it. 

 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

 

I felt that with my low experience in this process I did a good job understanding the whole development process and how companies and development teams might start the brainstorming process before developing a product. I felt I also wrote a well detailed template with good information about the product. The Gaming Room was looking for their own products and the step-by-step process. I provided a good analysis and breakdown of each platform for which The Gaming Room was looking to develop and deploy on. 

 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

 

The most important part for me was the UML design document and process that gave me a step by step walk through and hands-on learning experience to understand the whole process of developing the logic of good code and having the opportunity to look back and check if I was doing a good job. I find that I learn much better when I can have a reference to look back and check when I might get stuck and confused while developing code. 

 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

 
Looking back at the work I did I can say that I would definitely go back and revamp my breakdown and provide more detailed work on the deployment requirements on the server side and client-side slides. I would also go back and add more information to the security section of the design template. I found it hard to add more detailed information as my experience is not that well defined in some of the hardware of most Operating systems. 

 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

 
The users' need might be the most important consideration for developing a product. Having the ability to have user input while developing a application can help the developer keep a loyal customer base and over time improve the relationship between the users and the developers. This would also help the developer develop a great product that is tailored for the wants and needs of the users. Adding functions, the users are asking for will provide an opportunity to test new things that the development team might not have thought of before they started the development process. 

 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

 
 
The approach I took was to first lay down a step-by-step plan including the UML design which let me stay on track with each step in the process on what code needed to be developed for each section and then moved on and test every time each section was complete to see if the program was up to par with the plan and other code in other sections.  In the future I will develop a more in-depth game plan for developing any code and taking more time with each part of the application. Having good time management and not rushing each section helps a lot and I will be adding and developing a strong time management process in the future for similar code projects to produce the best software for users and other development teams.
